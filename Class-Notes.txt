Intro. to DevOps!!!!!

	SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle!!!
	
	Requirement Analysis
	Design
	Development/Coding
	Testing
	Implementation / Deployment
	Monitoring!
	
	Waterfall ::::  -- it is Linear in fashion!
	
		Requirement Analysis
		Design
		Development/Coding				java/python
		Testing
		Implementation / Deployment
		Monitoring!
		
		To Create a software application/Project!

	Agile Methodologies!!!
	
		Requirement Analysis
		Design
		Development/Coding				java/python
		Testing
		Implementation / Deployment
		Monitoring!
		
		To Create a software application/Project! -- having various modules / iteration.
			
		Iteration - 1					Module / Function 
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Development/Coding				java/python
			Testing
			Implementation / Deployment
			Monitoring!

		Iteration - 2
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Development/Coding				java/python
			Testing
			Implementation / Deployment
			Monitoring!
			
		Iteration - 3
			Requirement Analysis
			Design
			Development/Coding				java/python
			Testing
			Implementation / Deployment
			Monitoring!
	
		Finally, all these iterations are integrated and delivered as a software application.

	DevOps !!!!
	
Eg.: 
	E-commerce portal
	Facebook
	Tele-Comm 			Service providers ... 
	
	1 -- introduce new offer 
	2 -- 
	
	
	DevOps is a Software Development Strategy!
	
	Continuous Development !				===> related to Appln. DEV Team.
	
	Continuous Integration !
	
	Continuous Testing !
	
	Continuous Delivery !
	
	Continuous Deployment !
	
for code development, there are some time frame! --> 2 wks. 1

Integration !!!  

Test 2 wks 


	Software Application/Product!


	-	Monolith Application Architecture!
	
			All the process are deployment as one Application!!!
	
		Process / tasks / Functions / Modules 	
	
	
	- 	Microservices based Architecture!
	
		Create a service 
		
		1 process === 1 service 
	
	
E-commerce :
	www.amazon.com 
	
	List of Process / tasks / Functions / Modules :::
	
		User Sign-Up					-- Developer-1 -- once the coding is completed(Testing)! 
		User Sign-In 					-- Developer-2 --
		Search for products
		Add the product to cart
		Buy the product 
		fill the form 
		Make payment
		Place the Order
		Track the status
		
		
Application Owner / Architect

Difference between :	
	
	Continuous Integration !
	
	Continuous Delivery !
	
	Continuous Deployment !
	
Strategy -- Process -- --- Always subjected to Continuous Improvement!!!


Development Workflow :::

	Code the changes / Module / Service 			===> Java/Python/NodeJS/Angular/.Net (Programming Languages)
	
	Build -- Compile and Create Artifacts(*.war/*.jar/*.exe)!!!
	
	Perform Unit Test 
	
	Testing Teams 
		QA 
		UAT
		PreProd
	
	PROD 
	

	Continuous Integration  :::
	
		Code/Build/Create Artifacts and Integrate for further testing
	

Non-Prod Environment								Prod Environment ( LIVE Environment )
	
	DEV 											PROD 
	QA 
	UAT

	

The Production Release can be done by :
	
	Continuous Delivery		:	Before the code is promoted to PROD envi. we need Manual Approval from various Teams.
	
	Continuous Deployment 	:  	The Code can be automatically promoted to PROD Environment without any Manual Intervention.
	
As a DevOps Engg. is to automate this end-to-end CI/Cd/CD

	Code Build, Create Artifacts, Integrate for further testing(QA/UAT) and PROD Deployment

Business :::

	DevOps Team :::
		
		Identify the various Teams involved in the end-to-end SDLC Process
			Infra					
			Dev
			Test 
			Release Management
			Monitoring Team
			Prod Support Team
			Security Team
			
			Vendors 
	
		Creating CI/CD Pipeline
	
	Detailed DevOps assessment 
	
		Waterfall --> Agile --> DevOps --> DevSecOps --> SRE --> GitOps --> AIOps --> FinOps
	
	DevOps Tool :::
	
		
			Infra-structure Team		-- Provision the servers and config the servers  - 	Terraform/Ansible/Puppet/Chef/CF/ARM
			Dev							-- VS Code / GIT / GITHub
			Test 						-- Selenium/Junit
			Release Management			-- Anisible/Docker/Kubernetes/
			Monitoring Team				-- Promethus/Grafana/Nagios/
			Prod Support Team			-- AppDynamics		
			Security Team				-- Static/Dynamic Code Analyzer - Sonarqube 
			
			Build Orchestrator or CI/CD Tools: 
			
			Jenkins 
			Bamboo
			Gitlab-ci
			Azure Pipeline 
	
	
Version Control System :::

		Developer!!!	
			samplepgm.java	index.jsp
	
		Version Controlled!		
		It should be easily tracked!
	
		Visual Studio Code (IDE) --> to create the source.
		
		whenever we save the program -- it shd be assigned with a version. 
		index.jsp v1.0			Tested -- successful
		index.jsp v1.1
		index.jsp v1.2
		index.jsp v1.3
		index.jsp v1.4
		index.jsp v1.5			Tested -- Not working as expected	
	
	GIT --> Distributed VC System
	
	scripts :::
	
		shell 
		groovy
		yaml
		python scripts 
	
	
	DevOps Engg. write Automation Scripts.
	
	GIT ---> Distributed VCS ===> Local repo & Remote Repo
	
	Git is a Local Repository
	
	Remote GIT Repo / Servers
	GitHub is a Remote Git Repository
	Azure Repo
	Bitbucket
	Gitlab
	AWS Code Commit

	GIT File Workflow
	
	git:
	
	clone
	add
	commit 
	pull		fetch & Merge	
	fetch		only fetch
		merge/checkout
	push	
	
	GIT Installation
		
		Install git on Windows & Linux / Mac
		
		Linux Box
		
		AWS Virtual Machines - EC2 Instances!
		
			Login 			
			Create free tier account --- 12 Months
			Create VM's -- Amazon Linux -- t2 Micro 
			
		GitHub -- Create GITHub Account
